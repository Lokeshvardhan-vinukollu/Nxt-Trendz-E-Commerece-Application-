**E-Commerce Web Application:**

As part of my web development learning journey, I built a full-featured e-commerce web application to gain practical experience with React.js, client-side routing, API handling, and secure user authentication. The app simulates a real-world online shopping platform inspired by Amazon and Flipkart, and focuses on creating a seamless and secure user experience.

**Objective:**

To design and develop a responsive and secure frontend application that allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage user authentication—while applying concepts such as React components, routing, API integration, and JWT-based authentication.

**What I Built:**

Login System

Designed a secure login form using controlled inputs in React.

Implemented authentication using JWT tokens for secure login sessions.

Protected routes to restrict access to authenticated users only.

Product Listing Page

Fetched data dynamically from a REST API.

Displayed a responsive grid of products using reusable React components.

Included loading states and conditional rendering for a better user experience.

Product Details Page

Rendered detailed product information based on user selection using React Router params.

Used dynamic routing to navigate from product list to individual product view.

Persistent Sessions

Stored JWT tokens and user data in localStorage to maintain login state across sessions.

Implemented logout functionality to clear tokens securely.

**What I Learned:**

React JS fundamentals: component architecture, props, hooks, and state management.

Routing with react-router-dom to handle multi-page navigation in a single-page app.

Secure Authentication using JWT and route protection.

Real-time UI updates using React’s reactive DOM and conditional rendering.

Importance of code reusability, clean file structure, and modular components.

How to integrate external APIs and manage asynchronous data flow with fetch.

**Technologies Used:**

React JS – Core framework for building user interfaces

JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic and interactivity

CSS & Bootstrap – Styling and responsive design

React Router – Client-side routing between pages

JWT (JSON Web Token) – Authentication and session handling

REST API – Data interaction and backend simulation

LocalStorage – Persistent storage of session tokens

**Project Outcome:**

This project helped me solidify my frontend skills and gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications. It reflects my ability to develop responsive, secure, and interactive web apps using modern frontend technologies and best practices.
